  <ERN_BigCarbuncle.description>On worlds that carbuncle have colonized thoroughly, occasionally individuals will grow to a prodigious size, large enough to be ridden like horses.  What causes this is as mysterious as the origin of the species itself, but should a colony find such a rare specimen it is considered an omen of great fortune - not just because of superstition of luck-granting powers, or the rarity of the creature itself, but also just because who wouldn't want to ride around on such an adorable creature?</ERN_BigCarbuncle.description>
