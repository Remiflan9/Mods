	<description>Adds Victoria Valiant as your storyteller. She behaves sort of like Randy, but she generates more raids and with shorter cooldowns for you to recover. However, on the other hand, she also generates more events to make up this in raid difficulty. 
	
	Also adds a new difficulty called "Ragnarok awaits" which has 500% threat scale, with other variables set between Losing is fun and Blood and dust.</description>
